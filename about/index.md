I [bike a lot](http://www.strava.com/athletes/9684385) and I cook a lot, and I'm a champion of pigeons and pigeon-shaped life forms. I am very in to small data, and my main project at the moment is [readable](https://readable.af).

I graduated from the Gallatin School of Individualized Study at NYU in 2013 with a BA in Emergence in Complex Systems. My work has focused on cognition and computation, and the role of phase transition dynamics in emergent phenomena. My honors thesis, Artificial Intelligence & Emergent Computation, addresses the possibility that computational functions emerge from the interactions of simpler computational components that exhibit phase transition dynamics. I received the Special Award for Interdisciplinary Study from Gallatin, as well as the Deanâ€™s Award for Graduating Seniors to conduct post-graduation research on how road networks and leaf vein systems scale to growth in topologies versus free space.

I hold a MS in Applied Urban Science & Informatics from NYU's Center for Urban Science & Progress. At CUSP, I was part of team of graduate students that [estimated and mapped New York City's undocumented population](https://chohlasa.github.io/undocumented/) in anticipation of Mayor DeBlasio's municipal ID program.
