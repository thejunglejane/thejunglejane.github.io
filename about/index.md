I [bike a lot](http://www.strava.com/athletes/9684385) and I cook a lot, and I'm a champion of pigeons and pigeon-shaped life forms. I am very in to small data, and my main project at the moment is [datums](https://github.com/thejunglejane/datums), a PostgreSQL pipeline for Reporter application data.

I'm a member of the Data Science & Policy Team at [Case Commons](https://www.casecommons.org). In addition to conducting research and analysis in child welfare using Casebook application data, we have been working on exposing the child welfare in the application as more recognizable domain events to data consumers. We have advocated for a stabler and clearer data model to facilitate reporting, research, and analysis, and are working on communicating the challenges of doing data things to data in the social justice space more broadly.

I graduated from the Gallatin School of Individualized Study at NYU in 2013 with a BA in Emergence in Complex Systems. My work has focused on cognition and computation, and the role of phase transition dynamics in emergent phenomena. My honors thesis, Artificial Intelligence & Emergent Computation, addresses the possibility that computational functions emerge from the interactions of simpler computational components that exhibit phase transition dynamics. I received the Special Award for Interdisciplinary Study from Gallatin, as well as the Deanâ€™s Award for Graduating Seniors to conduct post-graduation research on how road networks and leaf vein systems scale to growth in topologies versus free space.

I hold a MS in Applied Urban Science & Informatics from NYU's Center for Urban Science & Progress. At CUSP, I was part of team of graduate students that [estimated and mapped New York City's undocumented population](https://chohlasa.github.io/undocumented/) in anticipation of Mayor DeBlasio's municipal ID program.
