We have metrics of our physical health. We can measure our heights and our weights and our blood pressures and our cholesterols and our temperatures. Some are solid, others less so, and in case we don’t fully understand what those measurements mean, there exists a group of people whose job it is to interpret them. We also have a general understanding of what helps and what hurts our physical health, and again, in case we don’t fully understand, the same group of people mentioned above investigates what impacts our physical health, and how. Like any understanding, there are different levels, and there is no guarantee that that understanding will impact behavior in one way or another. Because we may lack skill in interpreting measures of our physical health and knowledge of how different circumstances and behaviors impact our physical health, we seek the expertise of doctors.

The understanding of what helps and hurts our physical health, and by extension our ability to make informed decisions about our physical health, is, importantly, _a direct consequence of there being metrics of our physical health_. 

We lack comparable metrics of our emotional health. We have some metrics, to be sure, but they are overwhelmingly relative, and it is extremely unclear _what_ they are relative with respect to. Consequently, we lack a general understanding of what helps and what hurts our emotional health, and are thus crippled in our attempts to make informed decisions about our emotional health. Again, we do have some understanding of what helps and hurts our emotional health because there is, of course, a group of people whose job it is to investigate what impacts our emotional health, and how. It is also the job of this group of people to interpret measurements of our emotional health. The problem is not with this group of people; the problem is with the metrics themselves. They are not rigorous, and thus neither is any interpretation that is derived from them. 

The lack of understanding of what helps and hurts our emotional health, and by extension our inability to make informed decisions about our emotional health, is, importantly, _a direct consequence of there not being rigorous metrics of our emotional health_. The problem is, at its core, a data problem.

When a person or a group of people—say, an organization—is in the position of protecting to some extent the emotional health of individuals within that organization, the lack of rigorous, well-understood emotional health metrics is non-trivial. Consider: when the circumstances of your work environment negatively impact your physical health, there is an established and effective framework of resolution. This framework is made possible by the ability to identify harmful and/or dangerous physical conditions, which is in turn made possible by the existence of good physical health metrics (I cannot emphasize this enough). 

When the circumstances of your work environment negatively impact your emotional health, there is not an established and effective framework of resolution, let alone a framework that accurately represents emotional health issues and facilitates responsible resolutions. Such a framework does not exist because we lack the tools and understanding to identify emotionally harmful and/or dangerous situations in any kind of rigorous way, and the reason we lack those tools and that understanding is precisely because we lack good emotional health metrics (I _really_ cannot emphasize this enough).

How do we identify emotionally harmful situations? Like measuring an electric field at a point, the emotional health of an organization could be measured by taking the “emotional temperature” of that organization at a point, namely, an individual. What this ultimately boils down to is this: how does an individual within an organization _feel_? And following up immediately: how do we interpret that feeling?

The difficulty, you’ll notice, is two-fold. There is the difficulty as an individual of recognizing when you have been emotionally harmed and reporting it, and there is the difficulty as an organization of interpreting and assessing those reports. Both difficulties stem from the available data and the available tools.

There is also the problem of providing evidence of emotional harm and/or damage, the “burden of proof”. If I break my leg, say, I work at a restaurant and the cellar door is rusted all the way through and hasn’t been replaced or something, I can provide evidence of both the broken leg and the unsafe cellar door. My report is defensible, and there is a clear path to resolution. 

On the other hand, if I am harassed and suffer emotional harm, it is much harder to provide evidence of the emotional harm _and_ the harassment itself, especially if the harassment isn’t in writing, which systematic harassment rarely is. I cannot provide an emotional x-ray any more than I can provide evidence, beyond personal testimony, of the harassment. My report is far less defensible than my report of physical harm in the case of breaking my leg. My report is susceptible; it is vulnerable; it is at risk. It is unclear what has happened, what certainty to prescribe to my report, and thus there is no clear path to resolution. The likelihood of responsible redress is small, and how are we to conceive of responsible redress when we do not even understand what it is that needs redressing?

Perhaps what we need is better evidence of emotional harm and emotionally dangerous conditions. But what would better evidence of emotional harm look like? To require something like an emotional x-ray would be to fundamentally misunderstand emotional harm. Evidence of emotional harm takes the form, in point of fact, of feelings. The fact that I feel a certain way is evidence of a set of emotional conditions. But feelings, as we have just seen, are precisely the types of evidence that are “not enough”. Evidence of emotionally dangerous conditions is just as elusive. If several people within an organization suffer emotional harm, then their numbers serve as decent evidence of emotionally dangerous conditions. But we also require decent evidence in cases in which there is just one person suffering emotional harm, or only one person is reporting emotional harm. Feelings, the most accurate and representative evidence of emotionally dangerous conditions, fall far short of “decent” because, returning to where we began, we do not have good metrics of emotional health. 

You cannot serve food with a broken leg any more than you can build software with a broken mind. But while we can pretty much all agree on what counts as a broken leg, can we agree on what counts as a broken mind? We can’t, and that is the actual problem.
