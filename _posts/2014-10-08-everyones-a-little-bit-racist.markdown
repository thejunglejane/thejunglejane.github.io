I reviewed Christian Rudder's book "Dataclysm: Who We Are (When We Think No One's Looking)" for the [Wall Street Journal](http://online.wsj.com/articles/book-review-dataclysm-by-christian-rudder-1412372499). A huge thank you to the unwielding female force that is Jessica Kasmer-Jacobs for championing me-as-writer.
